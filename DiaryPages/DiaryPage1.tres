I promised that I'd start writing in you as soon as we got to our new house. Well guess what? We've finally moved in!

My room is just ENORMOUS and so full of colors, I love it! I played a while with my sister, that little Becca, she was sooo happy! Though I can't say who was happier, her or Sheila (Sheila's my little kitten!). Even if she acts like a princess a lot of the time, I can tell she really enjoys being here, she couldn't stop running around and exploring, not even for a moment.

I have so much space now, maybe even too much. There's plenty of room for new stuff [my books, my games, etc.], though I don't now's the best time to ask mom for anything else. I overheard her asking my new stepdad for some help... needless to say, he wasn't very happy.

But... it's okay, it seems they made up, at least. I'm trying really hard to bond with him, I've even started trying to call him \"dad\" to make mom happy.

Anyway, gotta go now, there's so much to do and to be honest I'm just so excited! Things are really looking up.

Tomorrow, we're going to meet the neighbors, hope I can make new friends!"
